# LLM Sandbox Project Overview

LLM Sandbox is a lightweight and portable sandbox environment designed to run large language model (LLM) generated code in a safe and isolated manner using Docker containers. This project provides an easy-to-use interface for setting up, managing, and executing code in a controlled Docker environment.

## Key Features

- **Isolated Execution Environment**: Securely runs LLM-generated code in Docker containers
- **Multiple Container Technologies**: Supports Docker, Kubernetes, and Podman
- **Simple Installation**: Available via pip with optional dependencies
  - Basic: `pip install llm-sandbox`
  - Docker: `pip install llm-sandbox[docker]`
  - Kubernetes: `pip install llm-sandbox[kubernetes]`
  - Podman: `pip install llm-sandbox[podman]`

## Core Concepts

- **Isolation**: Sandboxing LLM-generated code to prevent security risks
- **Portability**: Running in containerized environments for consistency
- **Safety**: Protecting the host system from potentially harmful code
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified interface for container management

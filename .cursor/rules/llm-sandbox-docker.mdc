# Docker Container Management in LLM Sandbox

LLM Sandbox uses Docker containers as the primary isolation mechanism for executing LLM-generated code safely. This rule covers the Docker container management patterns and best practices within the project.

## Docker Integration

- Docker containers provide an isolated execution environment with controlled resources
- Container lifecycle management (create, start, stop, remove) is abstracted by the sandbox API
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, network) can be configured for each container

## Security Considerations

- Containers run with minimal privileges and without host access
- Volume mounting is strictly controlled to prevent host filesystem access
- Network access can be restricted or disabled entirely
- Environment variables are carefully sanitized before being passed to containers

## Container Configuration

- Base images are minimal and security-focused
- Container networking is isolated by default
- Execution time limits can be enforced to prevent resource exhaustion
- Output capture is managed for retrieval of execution results
